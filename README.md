A neat GNOME extension that maximizes new windows that are in the irritating ALMOST-maximized state. This is probably an xorg issue. (Not seen on Wayland set.)

This extension deals with the problem (at least on xorg) that certain windows (e.g. mpv or kolourpaint) are not opened in a truly maximized state but do in fact SEEM like they are - they span the full width and height. So what is the difference?

Well, for example, when clicking the top panel, the almost-maximized windows will then suddenly fall behind any other maximized window that IS truly maximized. Annoying to just have your window disappear. There is just no excuse for almost-maximized windows to exist. It's like, make up your mind. Be clearly NOT maximized or be truly maximized.

Works super well in conjunction with: PanelHidesWindow (my other extension).
